# obsidian-submodule

Template repository for creating submodules for Obsidian writing vault.

Every project operates in a submodule. Drafts are sectioned out as releases. 
Everything is kept up to date on its own. Pertinent files applicable to every 
project are drafted here.

Current project architecture for story development:

```
story
|
|- ebooks/
|- graphics/
|- **overview
|- *outline
```

where `ebooks/` holds all `.epub`, `.pdf`, and related files; `graphics/` 
holds all files for book cover design, promotion, etc; and `**overview` and 
`*outline` are starter docs to get the main ideas of the story down.
