# general
The overview contains all the nitty gritty info with regard to the story *project*. High level story synopsis, book jacket blurb, etc. will go in the Story or Tale card. High level project links happen in this note. Story or Tale cards should be devoid of wikilinks, allowing only that they are linked to, not linking out to other notes.
